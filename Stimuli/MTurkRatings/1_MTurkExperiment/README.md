# mb3-rules: Experiment details
The experiment was instantiated using jspsych with additional js modules for Amazon MTurk, hosted on Standford servers and deployed via MTurk. Unfortunately IP capture only captured server IP instead of remote user IP, but analysis of responses indicated sufficient heterogeneity of responses to include the final set.
Experiment programming: Mo
MTurk modules, deployment, data collection & standardization: George Kachergis 
$$: Mike Frank
