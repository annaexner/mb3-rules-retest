Notes:
A. Python code note: PYDUB is a non-standard python library, available at https://github.com/jiaaro/pydub. It has additional dependencies, I used ffmpeg as the dependency..

B. Syllables_MB3_take2.docx is the current (latest) version of communications between stimulus team

C. Details of the stimuli (from Syllables_MB3_take2.docx) for this study, and, below, comparison with Marcus et al 1999

1. ManyBabies3
1.1. Training 
	• 250ms pause between words of a sentence
	• 1000ms pause between sentences
	• Random order
	• Single, continuous presentation

	1.1.1. Exp 1 training materials
		A = ku, ke, mu, ma, fe, pa 
		B = ka, me, fa, fu, pe, pu

		Combinations (17):
		ku - me, fa, pe (3)
		ke - fa, fu, pu (3)
		mu - ka, fa, pe (3)
		ma - fu, pe, pu (3)
		fe - ka, pe, pu (3)
		pa - me, fu (2)

1.2. Test
	• 250ms pause between words of a sentence
	• 1000ms pause between sentences
	• Random order
	• 3x of each of the 4 test sentences (=12 trials)
			• In each trial, a single sentence repeated with 1.2 - 1.5s pauses between sentences until 15s or 2s lookaway

	1.2.1. Exp 1 test materials
		A = ti, si, no, lo
		B = to, so, ni, li

		Combinations (4):
		ti - so,
		si - to
		no - li
		lo - ni

2. Marcus et al:
2.1. Training 
	• 250ms pause between words of a sentence
	• 1000ms pause between sentences
	• Random order
	• Single, continuous presentation

	2.1.1. Exp 1 training materials
		A = ga, li, ni, ta 
		B = gi, la, na, ti

		ABA = 4xA * 4xB = 16 sentences
		ABB = 4xA * 4xB = 16 sentences

	2.1.2. Exp 2 training materials
		A = le, wi, ji, de 
		B = li, we, je, di

		ABA = 4xA * 4xB = 16 sentences
		ABB = 4xA * 4xB = 16 sentences


2.2. Test
	• 250ms pause between words of a sentence
	• 1000ms pause between sentences
	• Random order
	• 3x of each of the 4 test sentences (=12 trials)
			• In each trial, a single sentence repeated with 1.2 - 1.5s pauses between sentences until 15s or 2s lookaway

	2.2.1. Exp 1 test materials
		A = wo, de
		B = fe, ko

		ABA = 2xA * 2xB = 4 sentences
		ABB = 2xA * 2xB = 4 sentences

	2.2.2. Exp 2 test materials
		A = ba, ko
		B = po, ga

		ABA = 2xA * 2xB = 4 sentences
		ABB = 2xA * 2xB = 4 sentences
