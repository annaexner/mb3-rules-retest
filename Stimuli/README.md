Stimulus creation: 
Stimuli were recorded in a quiet space using a Behringer Ultravoice Xm8500 Dynamic Vocal Cardioid Microphone with a pop shield, onto a Marantz solid state recorder in battery mode. Syllables were produced in as even a rate and as flat a prosody as possible. All subsequent handling and analyses were in Praat. 
	Individual syllables were segmented out, and clipped to nearest zero-crossings. All syllables were then concatenated with 250ms silence between each. The entire concatenated sound file was pitch flattened by setting the pitch to a constant value of 132Hz (the mean pitch across the recorded syllables). Individual syllables were then segmented out and adjusted to have a duration of 250ms (actual average 248ms±6.4ms), intensity of 70dB (actual average 69.83dB±0.3dB), and mean pitch of 132 Hz (actual average 132.38Hz±0.55Hz) each.
